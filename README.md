# FTS3 - Flavortown S3

FTS3 is a simple file upload service that uses S3 for storage. It is built with Elixir and Phoenix. It is intended to be used as a backend for other applications. It allows for files of unlimited size to be uploaded via chunking to bypass cloudflare 100MB limits. It also allows for files to be downloaded via a shortened url that is generated by my previous project URL Shortener (https://github.com/jam06452/url_shortener).
